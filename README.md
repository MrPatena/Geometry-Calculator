# Geometry-Calculator
- Can perform Geometry Calculations, round your answers, and check your previous answers.
- This was my first ever big python project that I attempted to create it took around a month or two to complete.

Credits: McJohnalds for helping with implementing the sine rule for a missing angle, and Golbarg Code for helping with animating the text
